# JobInfo

**A basic one page webapp module to showcase Job Info**

### What I used - **React.js, CSS**

### Things I've learned
The reason to make this small app, is soleley to sharpen what i've learned of React.js so far.
Use of useStae & useEffect and deconstraction of fetched data.

### What I'd love to do more with it
- is to use api instead of local data file
- make it part of a bigger project

Run **"npm install"** in command line from the project directory to install necessary react dependencies and modules
